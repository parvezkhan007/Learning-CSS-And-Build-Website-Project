    <h1>Unlock the Power of Blockchain</h1>
    <p>A payment rail is a payment platform or a payment network
         that moves money from a payer to a payee. Either party 
         could be a consumer or business, and both parties are 
         able to move funds on the network.[1] Credit card 
         rails are the credit card payment system. Blockchain 
         is considered a newer type of payment rail, as are 
         centralized electronic payment systems such as PayPal,
          Venmo and Zelle.[2] If the transferred funds are 
          available immediately, a payment rail is referred to
           as a real-time rail.[3] </p>
